class Event():
    """Represent a single event generated during the lifetime of a contract.  Such events
    represent the atomic analytical elements comprising all events that possibly
    occur during the lifetime of a contract.  That is, contract events mark specific
    times at which either a state transition, a payoff, or both is generated from a contract.

    Contract events are a generic representation of a specific state transition function and
    pay off function with an event time according to which all events in a contract are ordered
    (in an series) and processed sequentially.  Thereby, processing an event in fact means that 
    it's state transition and payoff functions are evaluated.
